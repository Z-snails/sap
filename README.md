Idris2 (s)imple (a)rgument (p)arser


A simple Idris2 library for parsing command line arguments.

It is designed in similar spirit to [collie](https://github.com/ohad/collie) but is slightly more constrained so that it can avoid slowdowns from the typechecker.

The library is initially created for use in [sirdi](https://github.com/eayus/sirdi), but it is designed in a general way so it may be use to other people in their own projects.
